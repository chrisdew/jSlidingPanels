jSlidingPanels
==============

This is a sliding panel system written for *non-scrolling* pages.  i.e. those which use `body { overflow: hidden; }`.

By default, all panels are present on page load, then slide away.  They slide back in on `mouseenter`, and slide away again a second after `mouseleave`.
